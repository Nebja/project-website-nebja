  title: About my work
  text: After finding my way in Berlin in 2012 , in 2017 i decided to go back to the job i loved so much back in 2005 , in Coding.<br>
    Since 2017 i am focused in web applications with some experience in  mobile and windows apps .I started with some small web apps for some friends (jQuery front end and plain PHP back end ) and after two years training as Software Developer,
    i ended up using Symfony during my internship. The last year in my current job i had to learn more about Vue.Js and i loved it.
    <br><br>
    More specific i have built 2 websites for some Friends with Symfony and jQuery ,a web app for storage management with Symfony/jQuery in my internship  and in my current job a web app for back-end with Symfony framework.
    In my internship i made also a Windows app with Java/JavaFx and a mobile app with Android Studio and Java.
    <br><br>
    I have used many languages in the past as i am Software developer since 2005 where i graduated from Institute of Professional training of Lagada. But as more businesses wanted to expand in the World Wide Web , i was drawn into PhP and Javascript .
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless i enjoy any programming language that i have to learn and that's why i am open to any future learning challenge i have to face.
